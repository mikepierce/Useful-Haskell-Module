# Useful Haskell Module

This is a Haskell module `useful.hs` containing a few functions I wrote
that were useful while solving [Project Euler][PE] problems
and learning the language. For example,

  - An implementation of quicksort, mergesort, and an iterative mergesort.
  - Some mildly sophisticated functions to lazily return the list of prime numbers.
    It's at least better than the function on the [Haskell homepage][HH].
  - Functions to return an integers as a list of it's decimal or binary digits.

I'm hosting this file on GitHub so that anyone who views my repositories 
can see that I am competent at writing code in Haskell.
