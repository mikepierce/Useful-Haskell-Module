# Useful Haskell Module

This is simply a Haskell module (useful.hs) containing a few functions
that I've found to be useful while solving [Project Euler][PE] problems
or doing other miscellaneous tasks. 

This is a basic change to test my new GitHub access token

I'm hosting this file on Github so that anyone who views my repositories 
can see that I am mildly competent at writing code in Haskell.
